Here is our final project for APCS!
The goal of this project was to recreate the classic game of battleship, a more true version of the game than we created in prog 2, equipped with a cpu and full GUI.
Constructing the game, we tried to make this in an object oriented fashion, which took more time than had we done it the same way as in prog 2, but proved more more fulfilling and useful in the long run.
Unfortunately, the GUI proved quite difficult. We now know way more than we care to about GUI's, but were unnable to fully integrate it with the underlying code.
Additionally, as we learned more about GUI's we realized the way we constructed the code wouldn't work, and had to rewrite our entire code base at least 3 times.
Then, in prioritizing the GUI integration, we ran out of time to complete the CPU as well as we wanted to.
It still has basic functionality however, picking targets as if it were a person. We also made fair progress towards more advanced tactics, present in the "selectNextTwo" method of the CPU.
We plan to continue working on this project, and plan to switch to a different visual method, as well as develope more advanced cpu characteristics.
